This is just a plotly plot but with clickability via javascript.
I am bad at javascript, so this attempt is an attempt.



# Earlier
I have looked into `plotly` and its ways of making interactive plots.
Plots with `plotly` and `dash` are impressive and can do what I ideally want, however,

I cannot host them easily on a github pages as the clickability cannot be clientside.

I did follow the guide on `https://github.com/dec0dedd/dash-actions-tutorial` but it did not help me.
